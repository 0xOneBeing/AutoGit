# AutoGit

AutoGit is a shell script that automates the process of executing Git commands to add, commit, and push changes to a Git repository.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/OxOneBeing/autogit.git`

2. Change directory to the `autogit` directory. Run `cd ./autogit`.

3. Run `./install.sh` from a bash command line. Note: You might want to run this using SuperUser privileges (i.e sudo `./install.sh`).

4. `autogit`is now installed and globally accessible.

## Usage

To use `autogit`, run the script with the commit message as the argument:
E.g. `autogit "Updated 'README.md' file."`

### Options

- `-v` or `--version`: Print the version of AutoGit.
- Run `man autogit` after installation to display the manual pages.

## Acknowledgements

- AutoGit was inspired by the need for an automated Git workflow and relative ease as a lot would be done with just one line of code.
- Thanks to [Sunday](https://twitter.com/0xOneBeing) and the contributors & supporters of the project.
